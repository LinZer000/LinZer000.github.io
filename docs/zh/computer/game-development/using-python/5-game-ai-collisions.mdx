## Front matter: What is AI in game?
- Congnitive simulation
- Bots / Opponents
- Processing
    - Collisions: fast and accurate
    - Opponents
    - Plans
    - Physics Simulation
- A Practicing view of AI ==> Speed and Simplicity in a game

## Collision Detection
- Necessity
- Problems
    - Complexity ==> Numerous Detection Tests
    - Quantized Time in the computer game ==> No Overlap
- Collision = Overlap sometimes
- Changed Places != Collision
- Detection Steps:
    - Whether a Collision is possible
    - Whether it actually happened

## Polygonal Objects
- a stright line that corresponds to the path taken by each vertex in the time between `T` and `T+1`
- Line L (`ax+by+c=0`) ==> Patth of object A
- A Collision cannot have taken place between that vertex of A and polygon B if B is on the __same__ side of that line at both time `T` and `T+1`
- (Vice Versa) A Collision may happen.
### Two parts (For performance) of Collision Detection
- Broad Phase Collision Detection
    - Substitute `x,y` in (x,y)
    - `<0` below, `=0` on, `>0` above the line
    - If sign changed, a collision is possible
    - (Exception: For the slope = the infinity, `a-x=0`)
- Narrow Phase Collision Detection

## Broad Phase Collision Detection
### "Operational" Methods (Silly but useful)
- Make sure u r not mking any tests that arn't needed!!!
- General Collision Times = `n^2` (`O(n^2)`)
- !!! Still Objects
- !!! Mutual Collision： A==>B == B==>A
- Objects that are moving away from each other
- Vary far Objects relative to their speed
- Classes of Objects: Opponents or Friendly Objects
- Example: 4 cars, 100 trees, 20 buildings ==> `124^2 = 15376 >> 486 tests = 4*3/2(between cars) + 4*120(cars and still objs)`
### Geometric Tests
- In 3D， Line ==> Plane
- Q? Do any of the polygons in set A collide with any of those in set Bots
- Extended Polygon==>Plane
- To determine a plane: 3 points OR __1 point + 1 line__
    - A point on + A normal line of the plane = The equation of the plane

### Using Enclosing Circles
- Objs are made up of polygons
- Process collisions at a higher level (Virtual Shape) at first to perform better
- Centroid: the center of the circle, the obj will be actually moved
    - `sum of polygon X OR Y coordinates / num of polygons`
- Radius `r`: the distance to the most distent vertex
- Sometimes (Quad polygons...) there is no need to use a enclosing circle.
#### Sphere vs. Plane Collision (Circle – Line)
> [!WARNING]
> Book P113 - `Need Further Learning`
#### Circle-Circle Collisions
> [!WARNING]
> Book P114 - `Need Further Learning`
##### Finding the Closest Point on a Line to a Specified Point
> [!WARNING]
> Book P115 - `Need Further Learning`
### Using Bounding Boxes
#### AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box)
- simple to model (calculate)
- easy to detect collision
- a poor fit to a obj
- recalculate when obj's direction changed
> [!WARNING]
> Book P116-7 - `Need Further Online Searching`
#### OOBB (Object Oriented Bounding Boxes)
- fit for an obj better ==> collision can be more accurately detected
- rotate when direction changed
- more expense on computing resources
### Space Subdivision (Block Map Method)
    Space are divided into qual-sized blocks, and an aeeay can be used to represent each.
    
    A block ==> a list of objs ==> `>=2`Objs in the same blocks ==> test collision
    
    - Need lots of Storage
    - Restricted Rules (P119)
    - Only need to update the moving objs (P120)
## Narrow Phase Collision Detection
    The more acuuracy we need, the more expenss we pay.
- In detail, assume that the polygons are triangles ==> each 3x vertices
- Shared Vertices are the most
- num of Distinct verstices (DV) == approximately num of Triangles
- each DV has a ray (directed line segment)
- assume 1st obj is still, 2nd is moving, calculate a net movement vector (relative movement vector) of 
2nd by minussing the velocity of 1st to both of the vectors 
### Back-face culling
- To eliminate some rays and some polygons, Found that only polygons 
that are on the side of the obj facing the other obj need to be tested ==> Back-face culling (a visibility algorithm)
- the dot product between the normal of the triangle and a vector from viewer's position (__e.t. another obj__)
    - 90-270 degree ==> facing
    - otherwise ==> not facing
    - Must be done from both objs, taking turns to be the viewpoint
### Ray/Triangle Intersection (P122 In detail)
1. Select vertices in A and determine their positions before and after movement
2. See if that line segment or ray intersects a polygon in B
    - If so ==> where and when detected 
- Three Way to determine whether the point inside the triangle
    1. The interior angle test =360degree
    2. The odd intersectuibs test: intersect with one edge of triangle exactly
    3. Sum of the area test
