## Mazes

-  Mazes are very important for many games
  - Pac-man, Zelda, Doom
- A "Procedurally generated" world

### Mazes in Myth: Labyrinth

Theseus in the Minotaur's Labyrinth, Use his thread to find the way back

### Classification

- Perfect: One path between TWO cells, no loops
  - Cell: the smallest geographical element of the maze
- Unicursal: No branches, just a single path
- Braided: Has Loops, no dead-ends
- Weave: passages go over and under each other (not quite 3d) 类似纪念碑谷

### Features

- Dimensionality: 2d 2.5d 3d
- Shapes: Non-rectangular, Toroidal
- Tiles: Cells can be non-square

### Metrics

- Passage length
- Dead ends
- Crossroads
- Bias
- Difficulty
- Others???

### Term(inology)

- a grid of cells
  - each is one space along a maze path
- cells have Neighbors
- Linked Cells ==> Part of Path
- Unlinked Cells ==> Walls
  - Direct travel is prohibited between cells that unlinked
- All neighboring cells will be either linked or unlinked

## Maze Creation Algorithms

- Random maze
- Classification
  - Carving: Start with a grid of unlinked cells and then choose pairs to be linked
  - Wall adders: Start with empty space and add walls and add walls to it

### Binary Tree Algorithm

- Carving
- North or East neighbor
  - the East column are all linked to their North neighbor
  - the North row are all linked to their East neighbor
  - North East cell is not linked North or East
- For each cell:
  - A list of all North and East neighbots
  - if list != empty
    - Pick a random neighbor
    - Carve it
- Easy to parallelize, put it in a data center 方便并行执行，如果你需要生成一个巨大的迷宫的话

#### Bias

- ![gm-dev-bin-tree-maze-bias](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-bin-tree-maze-bias.png)
- Top-row and Right-column are always clear
- Many North-East long way

- Exit Choosing
  - A Perfect maze
    - Put the entry/ exit wherever you want

#### Coding Time

- Data structures
  - Cell: Tracking neighbors and links
  - Grid: container for all cells
  - Markup: Tracking of some form of annotations/data for each cell (color, num, text, etc.)
- Binary Tree Algorithm
  - Iterate through all cells
  - no North or East neighbor do nothing
  - if not a_cell.est: a_cell.link(a_cell.north)
  - else r = randomly.choice([a_cell.north, a_cell.east])
  - a_cell.link(r)

#### Judgement

- A very simple algorithm
- Each cell can be handled in parallel
- Distinct look
  - Took row and Right column are connected
- Bias for diagonal (对角线的) flow

### Sidewinder Algorithm

- Carvings

#### Row at a time

![gm-dev-sidewinder-maze](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-sidewinder-maze.png)

- Top row: link all
- Other rows:
  - collect adjacent cells into "runs"
    - Add leftmost cell to "run_list"
    - Randomly decide to add the next cell to the run_list
      - Or end the run
      - Always end the run when there is no cell to the East

- When ending the run, link all cells in the run together
  - Randomly choose one cell to link to North neighbor

#### Bias

![gm-dev-sidewinder-maze-bias](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-sidewinder-maze-bias.png)

- Top row is always clear
- Horizontal  passage bias

#### Judgement

- ez, simple, efficient
- Each **row** can be handled in parallel
- Change the odds of the coin flip ==> The length of the horizontal passages

### Aldous-Broder Random Walk

- Random Walk Algorithm

#### Random Walk

1. Start in a random cell
2. Link to a random neighbor if that neighbor hasn't been visisted yet
3. Move to that neighbor
4. If there are unvisited cells anywhere, go back to step2

#### Bias

No Bias (First No Bias Maze Al)

![gm-dev-ab-maze-bias](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-ab-maze-bias.png)

What does bias mean??? 

#### Judgement

- No bias
- Look really good
- BUT:
  - Long time to randomly walk into the last cell
  - 768cells ==> 15232steps

### Wilson's Algorithm

- Also
  - Random walk
  - No bias
  - Inefficient

#### Random Walk

1. Choose some Cells as Visited cells
2. Start with Unvisited cells
3. Random Walk
4. Until meet a visited cell, end the walk![gm-dev-maze-wilson-walk](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-maze-wilson-walk.png)
5. Mark all cells on the path as visited![gm-dev-wilson-walk-maze-marked](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-wilson-walk-maze-marked.png)
6. Repeat steps 2-4 until all cells are visited

#### "Loop-erased" is what?

![gm-dev-wilson-walk-maze-loop-earsed](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-wilson-walk-maze-loop-earsed.png)

#### Judgement

- No bias
  - can't tell difference from A-B between Wilson's
- Low Performance
  - 768 cells ==> 4739 choices ==> 1288 removed loops
- In the beginning ==> hard to find a visited cell
  - In the end, it can find a visited cell quickly
  - It is always used with other algorithms

### Recursion Backtracker

#### "Recursion"

- A thing in terms of itself
- For memory's heap size restriction, we don't write it recursively

#### Trans a "List" into a "Stack"

- Stack: A last-in, first-out data structure
- Trans "List" into "Stack": Always operate on the end of a list
  - Use "append/push"
  - Use "Pop"

``````python
# A python stack
stack = []

# APPEND/PUSH
stack.append("Mazes")
stack.append("are")
stack.append("amzing!")

# POP
print(stack.pop()) # amzing!
print(stack.pop()) # are
print(stack.pop()) # Mazes
``````

#### Random Walk

1. Choose a cell to start
2. Random Walk into a unvisited neighbor
3. Link to and move to the neighbor
4. Repeat 2-3, until there is no unvisited neighbor, back up along the path until you do have one, and continue 2-3.

![gm-dev-rb-maze-2](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-rb-maze-2.png)

![gm-dev-rb-maze-3](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-rb-maze-3.png)

![gm-dev-rb-maze-4](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-rb-maze-4.png)

#### Judgement

- Has Bias: Long twist paths with few dead ends
- Not memory efficient
  - Need to keep the stack, which may contain every cell in the whole maze
  - Stack overflow
- Stack can be implement by
  - Implicit: a function
  - Explicit (Better for a large mazes): a list

## Maze Solution Algorithms

- !: Solution Algorithms can't see the entire maze just like us.

### Classification

- Wall Follower: can solve any maze if the entrance and exit are on the edge
- Dead End Filler: works for perfect mazes
- Recursive Backtracker: won't always find the shortest path
- Trémaux Algorithm: Can be used by a human

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

- A very famous graph algorithm, named after a very famous Dutch computer scientist
- A simplified version for mazes (a "breadth-first" search)

#### Goal: Least-cost path

- The cost (成本)
  - 1 if linked
  - infinite if unlinked
- In general, it works even when the cost is different

#### "Flood"

1. Mark the root cell, which costs 0
2. Create **Frontier**: A collection (set, list, ...) to hold cells (including the root).
   - "edge" the cells whose least-cost path you already know
3. Repeat 3, until the frontier is empty
   - Find The cell with the smallest value in the frontier `c`
   - Remove `c` from the frontier
   - Find all **linked** neighbors of `c` which are not already marked
     - Mark them with 1 + `c`'s value
     - Add them to the frontier

![gm-dev-maze-dijk](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-maze-dijk.png)

这和扫雷的生成算法有点像啊

#### Finding the shortest path

From the exit we set, repeatedly walk into the smallest cell until to the root (the entrance or any cell you set). 6543210

#### The Longest path

##### Finding

- Do Dijkstra's twice
  - From A
  - From B
  - A + B ==> C, which has the highest markup
- A ==> C ==> B

##### Usage

- Evaluate the difficulty, as a metric (度量) for how hard the maze is
- Place entrance/exit for a longer journey
