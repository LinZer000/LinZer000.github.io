## Navigation

- The process of finding a path through the world (likely related to geography)
- Control
  - "State Machine"
  - AI navigation

### The World == A Graph

- The world: consists of locations / ways to get between them

- A Graph = Set(V) + Set(E)
  - Vertices: Locations 
    - Points, Nodes, Rooms, Towns, Planets
    - Annotate Vertex with info about the place
  - Edges: A way connecting two vertices
    - Hallways, tunnels, roads, hyperspace links
    - Annotate Edge with info about the connection (like travel costs)

- Mazes are Graphs

  ![gm-dv-py-nav-maze-graph](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dv-py-nav-maze-graph.png)

- Today's Algorithms work on any graph (even it's not a tiled worlds, mazes)
  - Many Games use irregular convex polygons: Renowned Explorers, Civilization Series

- Aside: Game Sizes
  - How much real space should each vertex represent
  - [Grids in Games: Scale and Shape](http://www.zarkonnen.com/grids_in_games)

- Aside: Line Drawing
  - Bresenham's Algorithm: A fast, classic (1962) algorithm
  - Linear interpolation(LERP): Easier to understand
  - Orthogonal steps: Modification to either of above, fix "light leak" issue

### What is Navigation?

- Find a path from the starting vertex (V<sub>start</sub>) to the ending vertex (V<sub>end</sub>)
- Path: Set of edges (E<sub>n</sub>...), where n belongs to natural numbers
- Sum of (E<sub>n</sub>.cost) is minimized

## Classic Graph Search

### One source, one destination (OO)

- Greedy Best First Search
- A*

### One source, all destinations (OA)

- Breadth First Search: unweighted edges
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: weighted edges, cost > 0
- Bellman-Ford: weighted edges, cost can be negative

### All sources, all destinations (AA)

- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Johnson's Algorithm
  - A mixture of Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford

## Breadth first search (OA)

- Flood fill using a frontier
- Continue until the frontier is empty
  - Pick the first location from the frontier
  - Mark it as "visited"
  - Add unvisited neighbors to the frontier

``````python
frontier = [ start ]
visited = {}
visited[start] = True

while not frontier.empty():
	current = frontier.pop(0)
	for neighbor in current.neighbors():
		if not visited[neighbor]:
			frontier.append(neighbor)
            visited[neighbor] = True
``````

![gm-dev-py-nav-breadth-1](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-py-nav-breadth-1.png)

- BFS aims to discover if you can reach some destination cell

- Test is easy -- Just look at the visited dictionary

  ``````python
  def can_reaach(some_cell):
  	return some_cell in visited
  ``````

## Pathfinding with BFS (OA)

- To get the path, we need to save a bit more data

  - Usually, we want the shortest path

- Modification:

  ```python {10}
  frontier = [ start ]
  came_from = {}
  came_from[start] = None
  
  while not frontier.empty():
      current = frontier.pop(0)
      for neighbor in current.neighbors():
          if neighbor not in came_from:
              frontier.append(neighbor)
              came_from[neighbor] = current # 注意，这里不是路径本身，而是我们寻路需要的数据
  ```

  ```python title="get_path"
  def get_path(start, destination, came_from):
      current = destination
      path = []
      
      while current != start:
          path.insert(0, current)
          current = came_from[current]
          
      path.insert(0, start) #optional
      return path
  ```

- Technicality: A path is defined as a sequence of edges in a graph

  - Our path is a sequence of vertices
  - **Equally usable**

- The `came_from` dict can be used to find a path from any cell, not just the target

- This is a **flow field**, especially useful for tower defense games

## Early Exit (OO)

  ![gm-dev-py-nav-early-exit-1](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-py-nav-early-exit-1.png)

```python {1-2,9-11}
target = some_cell
found_target = False
frontier = [ start ]
came_from = {}
came_from[start] = None

while not frontier.empty():
    current = frontier.pop(0)
    if current == target:
        found_target = True 
        # Lets you know whether the loop stopped was caused by a founded target or not
        break
    for neighbor in current.neighbors():
        if neighbor not in came_from:
            frontier.append(neighbor)
            came_from[neighbor] = current
```

## Obstacles

- Goal: Ensure obstacles never get put into the frontier

- Pure graph: obstacles are represented by a lack of edge between two vertices

- Tiles: Don't regard obstacles as neighbors

  ![gm-dev-py-nav-obs-1](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-py-nav-obs-1.png)

```python {10}
obstacles = [ ] #list of cells that are walls/stuff
frontier = [ start ]
came_from = {}
came_from[start] = None

while not frontier.empty():
    current = frontier.pop(0)
    for neighbor in current.neighbors():
        if neighbor not in came_from and
           neighbor not in obstacles:
            frontier.append(neighbor)
            came_from[neighbor] = current
```

## Dijkstra's (OA)

- Edges have costs
- Cost > 0

### Idea

- Mark each vertex with the lowest cost to get there
- Put neighbors into the frontier with additional cost of the edge
- There may be multiple paths to a particular vertex (which means it will be in the frontier multiple times)
- Take out the lowest-cost vertex from the vertex
  - This means there can never be a lower cost path discovered to that vertex in the future

### Implementation

- This algorithm relies on an efficient finding method for the lowest cost of all the cells in the frontier
- **Priority Queue** (also called a **min-heap**)
  - Uses a list, but managed as a priority queue

```python
import heapq
frontier = [ ]
heapq.heappush(frontier, (0, start, None))
    #tuple of distance, cell, came from cell
came_from = {start : None} #Completed knowledge

while not frontier.empty():
    cost, current, from = heapq.heappop(frontier)
    if current in came_from:
        continue
    came_from[current] = from
    
    #early exit code could be here
    
    for neighbor in current.neighbors():
        if neighbor not in came_from:
            new_cost = cost + neighbor.cost
            heapq.heappush(frontier,
                           (new_cost, neighbor, current))
```

## Greedy best first search (OO)

### Heuristic Function

- Heuristic is a "rule of thumb (经验法则)" or a loosely defined guideline ==> imperfect

- ```python
  def heuristic(ax, ay, bx, by):
      # Manhattan distance on a square grid
      return abs(ax - bx) + abs(ay - by)
  ```

- Manhattan distance make sense for a grid of squares ➙ other situations, it might not

### Implementation

```python
import heapq
frontier = [ ] #tuple of h_dist, cell, came_from
heapq.heappush(frontier, (0, start, None))
came_from = {}

while not frontier.empty():
    _, current, from = heapq.heappop(frontier)
    if current in came_from:
    continue
    came_from[current] = from
    
    #early exit here
    
    for neighbor in current.neighbors():
        if neighbor not in came_from:
            distance = heuristic(goal.x, goal.y,
                                neighbor.x, neighbor.y)
            heapq.heappush(frontier,
                            (distance, neighbor, current))
```

## A* (OO)

- A combination of Dijkstra's and Greedy Best First
- Developed for robotics at SRI in 1962
- A best-of-both-worlds (两全其美) algorithm

### Implementation

```python
import heapq
frontier = [ ] #tuple of priority, cell, Dijkstra cost, came_from
heapq.heappush(frontier, (0, start, 0, None))
came_from = {}

while not frontier.empty():
    priority, current, d_cost, from = heapq.heappop(frontier)
    if current in came_from:
        continue
    came_from[current] = from
    
    #early exit here
    
    for neighbor in current.neighbors():
        if neighbor not in came_from:
            cost = d_cost + neighbor.cost
            priority = cost + heuristic(goal.x, goal.y,
                                        neighbor.x, neighbor.y)
            heapq.heappush(frontier,
                            (priority, neighbor, d_cost, current))

```

### Comments

- If GBFS would have found the right path, A* will explore exactly the same area
- But, if GBFS ➙ longer path, then A* is restrained by Dijkstra distance and keeps to the right path
- Dijkstra's algorithm is **simply A* with a constant** heuristic value
- A* uses the heuristic to re-order the search so it finds the goal sooner

## NavMesh (OO)

- Comes from robotics research

### Convex Polygons

- A polygon where any line segment connecting two points on the interior or boundaries ...
- ... contains only points on the interior or boundaries

![gm-dev-py-nav-convex-polygon](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-py-nav-convex-polygon.png)

- Features:
  - Easy to navigate between any two points
  - Just go in a straight line
  - Guarantees you will remain within the polygon

### Navmesh

- A collection of convex polygons that define all freely-traversable areas in your game
- All obstacles exist outside of the navmehs
- All polygons are connected by sides where traversal is allowed

![gm-dev-py-nav-convex-polygon-1](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-py-nav-convex-polygon-1.png)

- Navigation in the mesh
  - Target in the same polygon (RULE #1)
    - Go in a straight line
  - Target not in the same polygon
    - The connection of polygons from a graph (Use A* to determine the path)
    - Then use RULE #1

- Added Benefits
  - Each polygon must be 2D
  - But, the collection of polygons doesn't have to be
    - Exploit to model 3D objects

## Funnel Algorithm (OO)

- Improve the reality of the resulting path of Navmesh algorithm

- [Game Path Planning](https://jceipek.com/Olin-Coding-Tutorials/pathing.html)

  ![gm-dev-py-nav-funnel](https://r2.infinitedancing.top/gm-dev-py-nav-funnel.png)

### Idea

- Start at A (not the vertex)
- Consider the first **Portal** (two edges of the common line segment between polygons)
- Create a "**Funnel**" with the apex (A), left portal end, right portal end
- Consider the second Portal
- Move the left point of the funnel to the left edge of this second portal
  - Widen the funnel ==> IGNORE
  - We are looking for a straight line to travel from the apex
- Repeat with the right of the funnel
- If the update would cross the sides of the funnel (left-over-right or right-over-left)
  - Move the apex to the last point on the side of the funnel and start over
  - Keep track of where the apex has been, as that will be your path
- 总结为：先画一个**漏斗**，**交替**向前行走，**变宽**就要撤走，**换位**就要记录
